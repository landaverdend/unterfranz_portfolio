      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>I believe that effective therapy is built on genuine connection and trust. My practice integrates evidence-based techniques with a humanistic approach, recognizing that each person's path to wellness is unique.</p>

      <p>Unlike traditional talk therapy alone, I incorporate practical tools and exercises that you can apply in your daily life. Whether we're working through past experiences or building skills for the future, my goal is to empower you with lasting strategies for well-being.</p>

      <h2>What Sets Me Apart</h2>
      <p>I bring a combination of professional expertise and personal authenticity to every session. My clients often tell me they appreciate my direct yet compassionate style—I'll challenge you to grow while providing a safe, supportive space to do so.</p>

      <p>I'm licensed to practice in Illinois, Ohio, New Mexico, and Florida, offering flexibility for clients who travel or relocate.</p>
