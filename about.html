      <p>
        I tend to thrive in crisis. I deal with the toughest cases of trauma, shootings, cults, abductions, and domestic violence.
        I have supported veterans over 12+ years across multiple telehealth platforms. I emphasize the value of virtual therapy's
        comfort, allowing clients to open up safely from home.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach combines solution-focused and client-centered methods with insight-oriented work. Given my visual disability
        since childhood and traumatic brain injury at age 24, I bring personal understanding to working with clients managing
        physical pain and disabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have developed creative and effective coping mechanisms tailored to individual needs. I've worked across several states,
        valuing diverse cultural experiences. My hospital experience enables strong collaboration with medical professionals.
        Please reach out so I can meet you where you are.
      </p>
